# PS2 RetroAchievements — usage guide

How to run achievements on a real PlayStation 2 with Open PS2 Loader
(OPL) plus a small PC client. This covers what to install, what to turn
on, how the two menu items behave, and how in-game tracking works.

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental.** This is a hobby experiment, not a finished product.
> Treat it as one, and use it at your own risk. The tested setup is a USB
> stick holding your game images or the original disc; an exFAT HDD
> partition over BDM worked for one tester, the rest is untried.

## Overview

There are two parts:

- **The console** runs a patched OPL (`OPL-RA.ELF`). It hashes the game
  image, asks the PC which achievements to watch, then reads console
  memory every frame during play and streams snapshots to the PC.
- **The PC client** (`xerabora.exe` on Windows, `xerabora-linux-x86_64`
  on Linux, `xerabora-macos` on macOS) talks to the RetroAchievements server, tells the console what
  to watch, receives the snapshots, and unlocks achievements.

The console and the PC talk over the local network by UDP. No PC address
is configured anywhere — the console finds the client by broadcast.

## What you need

1. A PS2 that boots OPL (FMCB/FHDB, or from a memory card / USB).
2. A **network adapter** on the PS2 (the official Network Adapter for
   fat consoles, or the built-in port on slims) with a working IP —
   DHCP is fine. Configure it once in OPL: **Settings → Network settings**.
3. `OPL-RA.ELF` installed as an app in OPL (see below).
4. The PC client running on a machine on the **same LAN/subnet**, logged
   in to your RetroAchievements account.
5. Your game images (`.iso`) on a USB stick, or the original disc in the
   drive. These two we have tested, and they are the ones to play from.
   A game with an achievement set does not run from a network share;
   a game without one does. An internal HDD with an exFAT partition,
   which OPL reads over BDM, behaves like the stick for one tester; HDL
   partitions are not hashed.

A network share is not required (see "Running from USB only" below). It
is fine for the loader itself, `conf_apps.cfg`, the watch lists and the
diagnostic logs; keep the images you play with achievements on the stick.

## Achievements in five steps

1. Start `xerabora` on the PC and sign in on SETTINGS.
2. Boot `OPL-RA.ELF` on the console.
3. Highlight the game, press △, choose **RA: test PC connection**. The
   notice names the PC that answered.
4. Same menu, **RA: check game support**. Do this once per game, before
   you start it. The notice shows the title and the achievement counts.
5. Start the game. Play. Unlocks land on the page and on your profile.

Skip step 4 and the game starts as plain OPL: no telemetry, and the
client shows nothing for it. The rest of this guide explains each step.

## Installing OPL-RA.ELF

`OPL-RA.ELF` is a full OPL build (OPL 1.2.0 plus the RA additions), so
there are two ways to run it.

### Folder layout

Whatever the medium (USB stick, SMB share, HDD), use OPL's standard
layout. A USB stick, for example:

```
E:\ (mass0:)
├─ conf_apps.cfg          <- app list (see below)
├─ APPS\
│   ├─ OPL-RA.ELF
│   └─ OPL-RA-debug.ELF   <- optional, prints UDP debug logs
├─ DVD\                   <- your .iso images go here
├─ CD\   CFG\   LNG\   THM\   ART\   CHT\   VMC\
```

Game images are `.iso` files in `DVD\` (or `CD\` for CD-sized titles);
OPL lists whatever it finds there.

### conf_apps.cfg (so the app shows up)

`conf_apps.cfg` lives in the **root** of the config device and lists the
apps OPL shows under **Apps**. One `Name=path` per line. The path prefix
must match the device:

```
OPL+RA=mass0:APPS/OPL-RA.ELF
OPL+RA debug=mass0:APPS/OPL-RA-debug.ELF
```

- USB / block devices: `mass0:APPS/OPL-RA.ELF` (forward slashes)
- SMB share: `smb0:APPS\OPL-RA.ELF` (back slashes)
- Internal HDD: `hdd0:...`

Save it as plain ASCII with normal (CRLF) line endings — a mangled file
(everything on one line, stray characters) makes the entries disappear.

**If the OPL+RA app does not appear under Apps:** OPL is reading its
configuration from a different device than the one holding
`conf_apps.cfg`. Point OPL at the right device in
**Settings → (OPL) → save/config device**, or just launch the ELF
directly (below), which does not need `conf_apps.cfg` at all.

### The two ways to launch

1. **Directly from FMCB/FHDB/wLaunchELF:** point it at
   `mass0:/APPS/OPL-RA.ELF` (or the `smb0:` / `hdd0:` path). It boots
   like normal OPL. `conf_apps.cfg` is not involved.
2. **As an app inside a base OPL:** the base OPL reads `conf_apps.cfg`
   and shows **OPL+RA** under Apps; selecting it launches the RA build.
   This needs the config-device note above to be right.

Launching directly (option 1) is the most reliable and is recommended if
the app entry ever fails to appear.

## Notifications

The RA menu items report their result as an on-screen notice in the top
right corner, and they do so regardless of OPL's **Notifications**
setting (which is off by default). Turning that setting on only adds
OPL's own notices.

## The two menu items

Highlight a game in the list and open its context menu. Two items:

### RA: test PC connection

Broadcasts for up to 3 seconds and reports whether the PC client
answered. Use it to confirm the network path before playing.

- Success: `PC client found at 192.168.1.87 xerabora/1.0.0` /
  `Reply in N ms, console 192.168.1.142`
- No client: `No PC client answered within 3 seconds` — check that the
  client is running and UDP 18194 is open on the PC.
- No network: `The console could not open a network socket` — check the
  cable and the ETH device in Network settings.

### RA: check game support

Hashes the selected image and asks the PC whether RetroAchievements
knows it. This also downloads the watch list the console needs, so run
it once per game, before you start it (the list is saved next to the
game afterwards). A game you never checked, or one RetroAchievements
does not know, starts as plain OPL: no telemetry, and the client shows
nothing for it. That is by design, not a fault.

- Supported: `<game title>: N achievements` — you are ready to play.
- Unsupported: `RetroAchievements does not know this image`.
- Client busy identifying: `The PC is still identifying the image` — try
  again in a few seconds.
- No answer: `The PC client did not answer` — run "test PC connection".

## Playing from the original disc

Two more items live in OPL's **main menu** (press START in the game list):

### RA: check disc support

Reads `SYSTEM.CNF` and the boot executable off the disc through the
console's own driver, hashes them and asks the PC, exactly like the
image check. Run it once per disc; the watch list is then in memory (and
saved next to your other games when a USB stick or share is available).

- `Could not read SYSTEM.CNF from the disc`: the drive gave up on that
  disc. If the console does not boot it from its own browser either, it is
  the disc or the laser, not the software.
- `No disc in the drive` / `The disc tray is open` — as it says.

### RA: launch disc

Boots the disc under OPL's in-game hooks. Telemetry and unlocks then work
as from USB. Not available in this mode: OPL's virtual memory cards,
per-game compatibility patches and cheats, and the in-game power-off
combo. START+SELECT to leave the game works.

Tested with Shadow of the Colossus: identified, launched, 60 snapshots a
second for a full session, unlocks from the disc.

**Experimental.** A game this mode cannot boot may hang the console hard:
black screen, the reset button does nothing, only a power cycle helps.
Known case: Transformers: The Game (`SLUS_216.02`) -- the same disc
hashes and is identified fine, the game itself never starts. Games from
USB are unaffected.

## Playing and unlocking

Start the game normally from OPL. If you checked it (above), the in-game
hook begins streaming memory snapshots to the PC after a short delay; if
you did not, or RetroAchievements does not know the game, it runs as
plain OPL and the client stays quiet. Keep the PC client
running: it evaluates the snapshots and unlocks achievements on the
server as you earn them, exactly like an emulator. An unlock shows on
the client's page and, on the console, as a short gold flash over the
game. The client may be started or restarted while the game runs; it
picks the console up from its stream.

The console follows pointer chains as it reads, so achievements behind
one unlock like any other. A game needing more than 128 chains keeps its
direct reads and loses the rest; the client reports how many.

## The PC client

Start it and it opens its page in your browser. The page is the whole
interface: the client has no window of its own. Sign in on the
**SETTINGS** tab and paste the Web API key from your RetroAchievements
profile settings ("Keys"): the login is for unlocks, the key fills the
library, leaderboards and profile, and drives the following described
below. Both are saved in your user profile (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\xerabora` on
Windows, `~/.config/xerabora` on Linux and macOS).

Five tabs: **LIVE**, **LIBRARY**, **GAME**, **BOARDS** (leaderboards
with live trackers; softcore, so no entries are posted) and **SETTINGS**
(login, key, the network switch). The language menu sits in the header
next to your name, the FOLLOW MY PLAY switch at the top of LIVE, and the
red QUIT button in the footer.

**What LIVE shows.** It follows whatever you are playing, from one of two
sources:

- *The console.* When a PS2 with OPL-RA streams, LIVE is that game as
  the console sees it: measured progress (3 of 10), UP NEXT by the median
  time players take, missables you are about to lose, live leaderboard
  trackers, and a CONSOLE panel with the link, the snapshot rate and the
  losses. Unlocks happen here, with a toast, a sound and the gold flash
  on the TV. The console always has priority.
- *Your account elsewhere.* When no console streams, LIVE follows your
  RetroAchievements account: start a game in any emulator that has
  RetroAchievements turned on, and within half a minute the page shows
  that game, your unlocks in it, UP NEXT and the missable warnings, with
  a FOLLOWING panel: the rich presence line, the platform, whether the
  server sees you playing right now, and the unlocks of this session.
  New unlocks land as a toast and a sound. The client asks the Web API
  every 20 seconds. Measured progress and trackers do not exist in this
  mode; they need a memory source. The switch is FOLLOW MY PLAY at the
  top of LIVE, on by default.

The header of LIVE counts achievements and points, earned and total,
for the game that is on, and a strip below it shows the time the set
costs by other players' medians: when it is beaten, when it is full,
where you stand, and how many missables are still open. A set with
subsets lists each subset under its own heading. When the console goes quiet for ten seconds the
link is marked lost, the session clock stops, and following takes LIVE
back if it is on.

**On a phone or a second screen.** The page is served to this PC only
until you press OPEN TO THE NETWORK on SETTINGS. The tab then shows an
address such as `http://192.168.1.5:18280/`; type it into any phone,
tablet or PC on the same Wi-Fi and add the page to the home screen. Up to
four pages can watch at once, all live. Other devices see everything;
the login, the key, the network switch, FOLLOW MY PLAY and QUIT work
only from the PC that runs the client. On Windows, allow `xerabora.exe` through the firewall
when it asks (private networks). The setting is remembered between runs.
On a narrow screen the tabs sit along the bottom.

**Exiting.** About 15 seconds after the last page is closed, on the PC,
a phone or in OBS, the client exits by itself and says so in the log.
Keep one page open while you play. The red QUIT in the footer exits at
once. One
copy runs at a time; a second start opens the running copy's page.
Everything the client does is also in `xerabora.log` next to the saved
login.

Useful flags:

- `--console`: open a console window for this run (Windows).
- `--logout`: forget the saved token.
- `--port N`: listen on a different UDP port (default 18194).
- `--obs DIR`: write stream labels and `data.json` for OBS.
- `--ui-file PATH`: serve the page from a file, for working on it.

On Windows the client needs an inbound firewall rule for UDP (the
installer/first run usually prompts; if broadcasts never arrive, add an
"Allow inbound UDP" rule for `xerabora.exe`, all ports, on the active
profile).

## Running from USB only (no share)

This works. The console brings the network up on demand when you use a
RA menu item, independent of any SMB share:

- The watch list is saved next to the game on the USB device (and, if a
  share exists, a second copy there).
- The diagnostic log falls back to `RA/hashes.txt` on the USB device
  when there is no share.
- With no SMB session, the console has *more* free network
  sockets, not fewer.

Requirement is only a configured ETH adapter with an IP. If you boot
purely from USB, still set up Network settings once so the console has
an address (DHCP is enough).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| OPL+RA not listed under Apps | `conf_apps.cfg` is on a different device than OPL's config device, uses the wrong path prefix, or is malformed. Fix the path/device, or launch the ELF directly. |
| No on-screen messages at all | Turn on **Notifications** and cold-boot. |
| "test" works, "check" says no answer | Client not running, or not on the same subnet. |
| "could not open a network socket" | ETH device off/misconfigured, or no cable/link. |
| Client shows nothing when you press a menu item | Windows firewall blocking inbound UDP to `xerabora.exe`. |
| Game starts, client shows nothing | You did not run "check game support" on it, or RetroAchievements does not know the image. Check it once; if the notice says the image is unknown, the game plays without achievements. |
| Achievements don't unlock in game | Client must stay running; run "check game support" once first so the watch list is loaded. |
| Game from a share stops loading after about a minute | A game with an achievement set does not run from a share yet. Put the image on a USB stick or use the disc. |
| Unlock on the page, no flash on the console | Look for `console acknowledged unlock notice` in `xerabora.log`. Missing: the notice never reached the console, check that both are on the same subnet. Present: the console got it; report the game. |
| Page says the port is busy | Another copy of the client holds UDP 18194. QUIT it from its footer, or end it in Task Manager. |

## Notes and limits

- Console and PC must be on the same subnet (the client learns the
  console's MAC from its request).
- Images may be named `Title.iso` or the OPL Manager way,
  `SLUS_123.45.Title.iso`. ZSO/UL images and ELFs outside the image root
  are not covered.
- A game with an achievement set does not run from a network share yet:
  it boots, the console connects, and about a minute in it stops
  loading. The telemetry and the SMB stream share one network
  controller. Games without a set run from a share as before.
- Games that load their own network modules (DEV9/SMAP) may take the
  interface away from the telemetry when launched from a disc; from USB
  the same games are fine.
- Games without `libpad` may not start telemetry (the hook rides the
  in-game reset path).
